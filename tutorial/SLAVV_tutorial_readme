SLAVV methods paper software tutorial ReadMe

This folder contains screenshots demonstrating the use of the SLAVV software on two large, tiled example images (Images ending in "b" are from the second image).

Images 1-2: Wrapper script: OutputDirectory and start_workflow parameters

Images 10's: Vertex Curator: Global threshold selection and application

Images 20's: Vertex Curator: Local  threshold selection and application and (for "b" images) individual vertex toggling

Image  30's: Vertex Curator: Final curated Vertex set for edge tracing

Images 40's:   Edge Curator: Volume navigation, exploration, and )for "b" images) local thresholding.

Images 50's:   Edge Curator: Orthogonal Views

Images 60's:   Edge Curator: Addition Tool

Images 70's:   Edge Curator: Toggling Tool

Image  79b :   Edge Curator: Final output MIP over the whole volume with graded edge color weighting.

Image    80: Maximum Intensity Projection Outputs (Coloring: strand uniques, depth, and direction) from the middle (1/3 in all 3 dimensions) of the vectors overlaying the image.

Image    81: Histograms of various statistics of interest from the vectors in the image. 

Images  90+: Visualizations of the output vectors using a .vmv file output to the VessMorphoVis plugin to Blender.
